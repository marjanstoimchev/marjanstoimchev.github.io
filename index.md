## About Me

I am a PhD researcher at the Jo≈æef Stefan Institute, specializing in machine learning, computer vision, and remote sensing image analysis. My research focuses on developing innovative methods for supervised and semi-supervised hierarchical multi-label classification using deep learning approaches.

Currently pursuing a PhD in Information and Communication Technologies, I work on advancing the state-of-the-art in remote sensing image analysis through novel combinations of classical machine learning and deep learning methods, with particular emphasis on masked autoencoders and self-supervised learning.

### Research Interests
- Deep Learning & Neural Networks
- Remote Sensing Image Analysis  
- Semi-supervised & Self-supervised Learning
- Medical Image Analysis
- Computer Vision Applications
